# Dynamic JavaScript Landing Page:

This is an easy-to-use webpage that shows which section is active and allows the
user to scroll between sections quickly. Just open the .html file in a browser
and you can view the page.

It is designed to work on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

I created this project to learn more about creating dynamic content with
JavaScript. I struggled with creating the different JavaScript functions like
the setTimeout, but I researched these issues online and learned more about
how they worked, which helped me.

The first function dynamically builds the nav based on the html sections and
adds a scrolling function that listens for clicks. The makeActive function
shows which section is being viewed and changes the CSS styling. There are
also functions to show the nav when the user scrolls and hides it when the user
is inactive.

I hope you enjoy this dynamic landing page.
